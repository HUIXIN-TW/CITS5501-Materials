## Welcome to {{ siteinfo.unitcode }}  {{ siteinfo.unitname }}

Welcome to the website for {{ siteinfo.unitcode }}
in {{ siteinfo.year }}. Unit material (lecture slides and lab/workshop
sheets) for this unit will be **published on these pages, and not on
the LMS**{ class="hi-pri" }; but refer to the {{ siteinfo.lms }}
for recorded lectures and the unit outline.

## Unit overview

Software testing and quality assurance processes are critical to ensure
the success of software projects.
This unit covers testing and quality assurance topics including:

-  test processes
-  testing methods
-  verification and validation of software
-  quality assurance; and
-  formal methods for design and verification.

## Unit Coordinator

[**{{ coordinator.name }}**][coordinator-dir]{ target="_blank" }

::: { class="inline-table-ctr" }

```{list-table}
- - **Office**
  - {{ coordinator.room }}
- - **Email**
  - {% email_el_spannized coordinator.email %}
- - **Availability**
  - I work half-time at UWA, and am normally only on campus on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
- - **Consultation**
  - Email {% email_el_spannized coordinator.email %} for an appointment,
    or visit my office between 4-5pm Wednesdays. Students are also
    welcome to speak to me after the lectures. \
    **Changes due to Covid restrictions, March 2022**: While we're under restrictions due to Covid and most
    students are off campus, I suggest emailing me anytime up until
    Wednesday morning to make an appointment for an online meeting between 4
    and 5pm Wednesday afternoon.
    (Or, if between 4 and 5pm Wednesday doesn't suit, we can arrange some other
    time.) My consultation time is usually fairly quiet this early in
    semester -- if it gets busier later, I may get students to make
    bookings through Outlook instead.

## Weekly activities


**Lecture**

:   There is one two-hour lecture each week
    (starting in week ***one***{ class="hi-pri" }), at
    {{ siteinfo.lecture_time }} in CSSE Seminar Room 1.24.

    You should either attend in person,
    attend online (see the
    [instructions for joining with MS Teams](/resources/#streamed-lectures)),
    or watch the recorded lecture on {{ siteinfo.lms }}.

**Lab/workshops**

:   You should attend one lab/workshop each week, starting in week
    ***two***{ class="hi-pri" }.\
    However, as long as there is room available for you, you are welcome to attend other
    sessions as well.

    The first hour of the lab/workshop is supervised by one of the unit
    facilitators, Santiago and Alvaro; the lab is booked for the second hour
    for your own use (e.g. for working on quizzes or the project).

There are currently two face-to-face lab/workshop sessions:

- Wednesday, 12 noon--2 pm, in CSSE lab 2.05
- Wednesday, 2 pm--4 pm, in CSSE lab 2.05

You can always get full details of lecture and lab times and venues by
visiting UWA's **{{ siteinfo.year }} [Timetable site][cits5501-timetable]{ target="_blank" }**{ class="hi-pri" }.
(If the information for {{ siteinfo.unitcode }} is not visible, then enter "CITS5501" in the
box labelled "Unit search", and then click "Show timetable".)

[cits5501-timetable]: https://timetable.applications.uwa.edu.au/?selectunits={{ siteinfo.unitcode }}

### Lecture recordings

**The lectures are recorded**{ class="hi-pri" }, and will be
available via the {{ siteinfo.lms }} -- usually within an
hour of the lecture finishing. (But please note that recordings do
sometimes fail -- so if you *can* attend the lecture in-person or
online, it's recommended.)

### Time required

Note that materials presented during class sessions
**<span>*do not*</span> define the whole unit**{ class="hi-pri" }.
A six-point unit is deemed to be equivalent to one quarter of a
full-time workload, so you would be expected to commit 10--12 hours
per week to the unit, averaged over the entire semester.
Outside of the contact hours (3 hours per week) for the unit, the
remainder of your time should be spent reading the recommended reading,
attempting exercises and working on assignment tasks.

### Preparing for lectures

The [**schedule**](schedule){ class="hi-pri" }
contains the list of **recommended readings**{ class="hi-pri" } for each
topic. To gain maximum benefit from the lectures and workshops, I
recommend you at least review these *before* attending class.

### Who'll be helping in lab/workshops { #facilitators }

Our facilitators for lab/workshops are:

- Santiago Aguilar
- Alvaro Ballester

{% set facilitators = ['santiago', 'alvaro'] %}

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly;">
{% for facilitator in facilitators %}
<figure>
<img src="{{ '/images/' + facilitator + '.jpg' | url }}" width=120px height=120px style="border-radius: 30%;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;" >{{ facilitator | initialCap }}</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endfor %}
</div>

## Assumed knowledge

Completion of 12 points of programming-based units is a prerequisite
for enrolling in CITS5501. In particular, it's assumed that you are
familiar with programming in at least one object-oriented language
(typically either Python or Java). Please let the Unit Coordinator
know as soon as possible if this is not the case.

Some basic familiarity with testing frameworks for that language will be
helpful.

- **For CITS1001**{ class="hi-pri" } (which uses the Java programming
  language), the relevant testing framework is [JUnit][junit]{ target="_blank" }.
  The textbook for CITS1001, [*Objects First with
  Java*][objects-first]{ target="_blank" } by Barnes and KÃ¶lling,
  contains good coverage of JUnit in Chapter 9, "Well-behaved
  objects".
- **For CITS1401**{ class="hi-pri" } (which uses the Python programming
  language), the relevant testing framework is
  [`unittest`][py-unittest]{ target="_blank" }.  The Python
  documentation contains basic examples of usage of the `unittest`
  library.

## Feedback survey

We want to ensure everyone enrolled in the unit is able to access
lectures, lab/workshops, and a suitable Java development environment in which to
complete exercises and assignments. We also want to find out what you're
finding useful (or not) about the unit.

So there is a survey for CITS2003/CITS4407 students available on the MS
Teams page for the unit -- you can also reach it by clicking
[**here**][survey-link]{ target="_blank" class="hi-pri" }. If you can
assist us by completing the survey before the end of **week 4**{:
class="hi-pri" :} (i.e., 5 pm Friday, 19 March) that would be greatly
appreciated.
