### Short assessments (quiz or exercise) {#quiz}

For three weeks (3, 6 and 9), there will be either a quiz
or a short exercise. Quizzes will be done on the LMS, and exercises
will be submitted via cssubmit; further details will be released
closer to the due dates.

#### Week 3 Quiz

- This quiz will be available on the [**LMS**][lms]{: target="_blank" class="hi-pri" :}
  from 10am Tuesday 9th March until 11:59pm Sunday 14th March.
- Ensure you leave at least 1-2 hours available in which to complete it.
  If you wait until after 10pm Sunday 14th March to start the quiz, and
  don't complete it, you will be awarded 0 marks.
- The quiz is not timed, and there is no time limit, but it will need to
  be completed in one sitting, and students are allowed only one attempt
  at it.
- You will not be able to correct your answer to a question once you
  have answered it.
- The quiz is open-book; you can make use of any book, website or
  software you like.
- Questions may be drawn from any content contained in lectures, lecture
  slides, lab/workshop exercises or assigned readings up until the end
  of week 2 (i.e. the week commencing Monday 8 March), or may require
  you to make reasonable inferences from that material or to investigate
  questions arising from that material.
- Ensure you have a good Internet connection when sitting the quiz – you
  should sit it either on a UWA lab computer, or at home, but not using
  WiFi or a mobile device, as these could drop out part-way through.
- If you use a WiFi or mobile connection and it fails, you won’t be
  given extra time to complete the quiz.  
  If for some reason you can't access the quiz on the LMS, email me
  immediately from your University email account with a screenshot or
  photo showing the problem.

#### Week 6 Exercise

The week 6 exercise is available on the 
[**LMS**][lms]{: target="_blank" class="hi-pri" :},
under "Week 6 Exercise".

It is due by 11:59pm, Tuesday 6 April (later than
originally due, to avoid it falling on a public holiday weekend).

The exercise should not take long to do -- only brief answers
(a paragraph or two for each question) are expected. It is to
be done individually, but you may make use of any
textbooks, slides or similar resources you like.

The marking rubric is available [here][exercise-rubric] (PDF).

#### Week 9 Exercise

The week 9 exercise is available
[here][wk-9-exercise]{: target="_blank" class="hi-pri" :} (PDF).
As [`cssubmit`][cssubmit-wk-9] is up and working, we shall use it
for submitting your answers. See the exercise PDF for the due
date and full submission procedure.

### Tips for using cssubmit {#cssubmit-tips}

-   Make sure you submit in the correct format (specified
    for each assessment).
-   Make sure you have agreed to the submission conditions
    and confirmed this is original work
-   Make sure you ***print***{: class="hi-pri" :} off the confirmation
    page as a record afterwards
-   The end result should look something like this
    (click for a larger image); make sure it says 1 file was
    submitted and validated successfully.<br><br>
